# YSRobot-for-converting-decimal-numbers-to-binary---Scratch-
My project features a robot that facilitates the conversion of decimal numbers into binary. The robot, named YSRobot, operates with a capacity of 8 bytes. Users can input decimal numbers, and the robot systematically converts them into their binary equivalents, providing an output in the form of 8-bit binary representations.
